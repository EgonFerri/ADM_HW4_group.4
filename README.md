## 1) Does basic house information reflect house's description?

In this assignment we will perform a clustering analysis of house announcements in Rome from Immobiliare.it. 

#### Download sets of articles

The data in usage are downloaded from [immobiliare.it](https://www.immobiliare.it). In particular, we retrieve announcements starting from this [link](https://www.immobiliare.it/vendita-case/roma/?criterio=rilevanza&pag=1).

This data will be the corpus for our analysis.

## 2) Find the duplicates!

We are given [`passwords2.txt`](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wTmOU-yqk4qdQYg42AquhzgpNGrRA96d) file as input. Each row corresponds to a string of 20 characters.We have to Define an hash function that associates a value to each string. In this case, the goal is to check whether there are some duplicate strings. Our definition of duplicate is that the two strings have the __same characters__, order is not important. Thus, "AABA" = "AAAB".
